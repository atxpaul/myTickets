## Starting server:

The way to start server as pure node is with the following examples:

Starting with npm script

```sh
npm start
```

Starting as cluster

```sh
node src/server.js -m=cluster
```

You can specify the number of cores with -c, example:

```sh
node src/server.js -m=cluster -c=3
```
